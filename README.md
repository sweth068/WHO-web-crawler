This Python script automates the extraction of chemical compound names from WHO's International Nonproprietary Names (INN) lists hosted on their official website. It begins by scraping relevant URLs containing INN proposal list PDFs, downloads each file, verifies its validity as a PDF, and parses its text content to extract candidate compound names using basic filtering and regular expressions. The script is designed to normalize and clean extracted names to minimize duplicates and remove common noise. The chemical names are then queried against PubChem to retrieve metadata such as PubChem CID, molecular formula, molecular weight, and IUPAC name.

The compound metadata is processed in batches to respect PubChem's request limits and includes a delay to avoid overloading the API. Final results for each PDF are saved as individual CSV files, making it easy to analyze or use in downstream projects. Temporary PDF files are deleted after processing to save space. This tool is useful for researchers, informaticians, or regulatory analysts looking to automate compound data extraction and enrichment from WHOâ€™s INN documentation.
